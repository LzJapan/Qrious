"QRious"-CentralAsia – A Regional Cybersecurity Awareness Project 🛡️

QRious-CentralAsia is a cybersecurity awareness project based in Central Asia that explores how human curiosity — especially among youth — leads people to scan unknown QR codes. In a region with growing internet access but low cybersecurity awareness, this experiment simulates real-world phishing-style traps to study behavior and promote safer digital habits. It targets diverse demographics and public venues to inform better security practices.

🌍 Why Central Asia?
Countries like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan are undergoing rapid digital transformation — from e-government portals to mobile banking — but many users still scan QR codes without fully understanding the risks.

⚠️ QR codes are becoming a major cybersecurity threat, especially in regions with limited digital literacy. Many users in Central Asia are unaware that scanning a malicious QR code can lead to phishing sites, malware downloads, or data theft — all without them realizing what's happening.
This project brings attention to that danger through education and ethical experimentation.

Key Challenges:
📉 Most users don’t verify what’s behind QR codes

🧠 Younger people are often more curious, but less cautious

🚨 QR phishing (“quishing”) is a rising global threat

This project directly addresses a local and growing cybersecurity risk.

🎯 Project Goals
🧠 Raise awareness about QR-based phishing attacks

📈 Study behavioral differences by age group (youth vs older adults)

📍 Focus on Central Asian environments (campuses, cafes, markets)

📊 Collect and visualize real-world scanning behavior

🧪 How the Experiment Works
Generate a QR code that links to an educational landing page

Label it with a curiosity trigger:

⚠️ Do NOT Scan This QR Code

Place QR codes in real settings across Central Asia:

School hallways

Internet cafés

Telegram community boards

Track anonymous scan data:

Total number of scans

Estimated age group (via optional poll or form)

Environment type (urban, campus, market, etc.)

📱 Recommended Safe QR Scanners in Central Asia
Due to regional app restrictions, these are reliable and accessible tools:

Trend Micro QR Scanner (Android / iOS)
→ Previews link and warns about malicious URLs

QR & Barcode Scanner by Gamma Play (Android)
→ Lightweight and widely used

ZXing Decoder (Web tool)
→ Upload any QR image to preview safely
→ ZXing Web Tool

⚠️ Disclaimer
This is an educational cybersecurity awareness project. It does not involve:

Real phishing pages or malware

Collection of personal or identifying information

Forced interaction — QR scans are voluntary

All activities comply with local public display rules and ethical research standards.

📊 Results & Impact (To Be Updated)
Planned updates will include:

Scan data by age group and location

Anonymous user reactions or quotes

Visual charts of scan behavior patterns
