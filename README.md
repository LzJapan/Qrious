# QRious-CentralAsia – A Regional Cybersecurity Awareness Project 🛡️

**QRious-CentralAsia** is a cybersecurity awareness project based in Central Asia that explores how human curiosity — especially among youth — leads people to scan unknown QR codes. In a region with growing internet access but low cybersecurity awareness, this experiment simulates real-world phishing-style traps to study behavior and raise digital safety awareness.

## 🌍 Why Central Asia?

Countries like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan are experiencing rapid digitalization — from e-government to mobile banking — but many users still scan QR codes without caution.

- QR phishing (“quishing”) is a rising threat
- Most users **don’t verify** what’s behind QR codes
- Young people are often more curious but less cautious

This project addresses a **real local cybersecurity risk**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🧠 Raise awareness about QR-based phishing attacks  
- 📈 Study behavioral differences by age group (youth vs older adults)  
- 📍 Focus on Central Asian settings (campuses, cafes, markets)  
- 🧪 Collect and visualize real-world scanning behavior

## 🧪 How the Experiment Works

1. Generate a QR code linking to an **educational landing page**
2. Label it with a curiosity trigger:  
   > ⚠️ **Do NOT Scan This QR Code**  
3. Post in real Central Asian settings:  
   - School halls  
   - Internet cafés  
   - Telegram channels  
4. Track:
   - Number of scans  
   - Estimated age group (via poll or form)
   - Location type (urban, campus, etc.)

## 📱 Safety Apps Recommended in Central Asia

Due to app restrictions in the region, here are scanners that work reliably:

- **Trend Micro QR Scanner** *(Android / iOS)*  
  → Shows link + warns about malicious content

- **QR & Barcode Scanner by Gamma Play** *(Android)*  
  → Very popular and lightweight

- **ZXing Decoder** *(Web)*  
  → Upload QR code to preview safely (no app needed)  
  → [ZXing Web Tool](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx)
